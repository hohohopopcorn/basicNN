# basicNN
Neural Networks that can approximate any functions given a sample of data points. These Neural Network uses Conjugate Gradient as an update method and is written in C.

# Gradient CG Network Streamlined.cpp
A Neural Network that approximates a function space based a sample of the gradients of the function.
